## Overview
This repo is a collection of data-warehouse-focused projects for DATA 226. Each project demonstrates core concepts such as:
- Data ingestion and ETL (extract, transform, load)
- Dimensional modeling (star/snowflake schemas)
- Fact and dimension table design
- Loading into an analytical store (SQLite/Postgres/Redshift/etc.)
- Basic analytics and reporting using Python notebooks

---

## Repository layout (suggested)
- README.md — this file
- requirements.txt — Python dependencies
- data/ — raw and processed sample datasets (gitignored large files)
- notebooks/ — Jupyter notebooks for exploration, ETL demos, and analysis
- src/
  - etl/ — ETL scripts and utilities (Python)
  - models/ — schema creation scripts (SQL or Python)
  - utils/ — helper utilities
- sql/ — reusable SQL queries and table DDLs
- docs/ — project documentation, diagrams, data dictionary
- tests/ — unit and integration tests
- reports/ — final reports, slides, or visual outputs

Adjust actual layout to the files you have; this is a recommended structure.

---

## Getting started

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (3.9/3.10 recommended)
- pip
- Optional: virtualenv, Docker

Quick setup
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Centhurvelan/DATA_WAREHOUSE_PROJECTS_DATA226.git
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   (or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Start Jupyter Lab / Notebook to run notebooks:
   jupyter lab

If you prefer Docker, add a Dockerfile or docker-compose for reproducible environments.

---

## Example workflow (typical project)
1. Place raw data files in data/raw/ (or provide download script)
2. Run exploratory notebook in notebooks/ to understand data
3. Implement ETL:
   - Clean and transform raw data (src/etl/)
   - Create dimensional model SQL (sql/create_schema.sql)
   - Load transformed data into target (SQLite/Postgres/Redshift)
4. Run analytics notebooks in notebooks/ using loaded data
5. Export reports in reports/

Example commands (adapt to your scripts):
- Run ETL: python src/etl/run_etl.py --config config/dev.yaml
- Create schema: psql -f sql/create_schema.sql
- Run tests: pytest -q

---

## Data modeling & schema
Projects use dimensional modeling patterns:
- Fact tables: measurable, transactional data (e.g., sales, events)
- Dimension tables: descriptive attributes (e.g., users, products, time)
- Star schema is favored for readability and analytics performance

Include an ER diagram in docs/ for each project and a data dictionary describing each column and table.

---

## Notebooks & scripts
- notebooks/exploration.ipynb — data profiling and exploration
- notebooks/etl_demo.ipynb — step-by-step ETL demo
- src/etl/ — production-ready ETL routines (use CLI args or config files)
- Use config files (YAML/JSON) to parameterize environments (dev/test/prod)

---

## Tests
- Use pytest for unit tests in tests/
- Add integration tests for full ETL runs using a small sample dataset
- Example:
  pytest tests/test_etl.py::test_transform

---

## Contributing
- Open an issue for feature requests or bugs
- Create a branch for your work: git checkout -b feat/your-feature
- Keep commits small and focused; write clear commit messages
- Submit a pull request; include a clear description and related issue number
- Follow Python style and linting (black, flake8 recommended)
